chainWall is a blockchain-powered firewall that makes network security verifiable. It anchors packet logs and alerts on-chain, creating an immutable audit trail while sharing real-time threat data across nodes. A next-gen defense system built on trust, transparency, and decentralization.

chainWall is a firewall reimagined for the blockchain era.
It doesn’t just block suspicious traffic — it proves why it blocked it.
Each network event (packet, intrusion attempt, rule update) is hashed and anchored on-chain, creating an immutable security ledger.
This makes logs tamper-proof and allows nodes to share reputation and alerts in real time.

chainWall stands out by combining blockchain anchoring, peer-to-peer alerts, and consensus validation. Every event is written to a tamper-proof ledger, with alerts shared across nodes in real time. It supports Bitcoin, EVM, and Stacks, and builds a shared reputation layer for smarter defense.

Traditional firewalls are centralized and often vendor-locked. They store logs locally, leaving them open to tampering or deletion. There’s no trustless validation, no multi-node agreement, and no transparent way to verify why a packet was blocked. Once compromised, the entire system can be blind to threats.

Web3 security tools add some decentralization but often stop short. Many rely on manual reporting or single-chain proofs, offering limited automation and adoption. chainWall takes things a step further—using blockchain consensus and cross-chain anchoring to make trust and verification built-in, not optional.

chainWall creates a verifiable, decentralized trust layer for network security.


Market Fit
1) Target users:
- Enterprises that need audit-proof firewall logs.
- Governments or defense networks seeking tamper-proof infrastructure.
- Data centers and ISPs needing real-time, cross-network reputation sharing.

2)Problem solved:
- Traditional firewalls are black boxes — once compromised, logs can be altered.
- chainWall’s blockchain-backed audit trail makes tampering impossible.


Core Mechanisms
1) Anchored Event Ledger:
Hashes of blocked packets and rule updates are batched and written to a blockchain.

2) Reputation P2P Network:
Nodes share suspicious IPs and signatures, forming a live, verifiable threat map.

3) Consensus Validation:
Multiple nodes sign off on alert authenticity before anchoring.

4)Chain-Agnostic Anchoring:
Supports Bitcoin, Stacks, or Ethereum depending on performance and cost.
