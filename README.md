# chainWall
**chainWall** is a blockchain-powered firewall that makes network security verifiable. It anchors packet logs and alerts on-chain, creating an immutable audit trail while sharing real-time threat data across nodes. A next-gen defense system built on trust, transparency, and decentralization.

chainWall is a firewall reimagined for the blockchain era.
It doesn’t just block suspicious traffic — it proves why it blocked it.
Each network event (packet, intrusion attempt, rule update) is hashed and anchored on-chain, creating an immutable security ledger.
This makes logs tamper-proof and allows nodes to share reputation and alerts in real time.

🚀 Why It’s Different
Feature	                  chainWall	          Traditional Firewalls	    Web3 Security Tools
Immutable Logs	    ✅ On-chain anchoring	         ❌ Centralized	         ⚠️ Partial (SIEM)
Trustless Alerts	  ✅ Peer-to-peer gossip	       ❌ Vendor-locked	       ⚠️ Manual
Consensus Engine	  ✅ Multi-node validation	     ❌ None	               ⚠️ Optional
Multi-chain Proofs	✅ Bitcoin, EVM, Stacks	       ❌None	                 ⚠️ Often single-chain
Reputation Scoring	✅ Shared threat signals	     ❌	None                 ⚠️ Limited adoption

chainWall creates a verifiable, decentralized trust layer for network security.
